<h2>Business Problem</h2>
<p>Zomato wanted to identify why some cities had lower delivery ratings and higher failed deliveries. The goal was to analyze performance across cities, identify patterns causing delays or bad experiences, and recommend actions to improve delivery partner efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p>

    <li>SQL for generating insights</li>
    <li>Machine learning to predict if the city will have high rating or not based on features like cuisine,price range,votes,city etc</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Business Impact</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Uncovered top 3 drivers of low delivery ratings:</strong> lack of online delivery, poor locality serviceability, and high price range without value justification.</li>
  <li><strong>Insights guided hyperlocal strategy</strong> for partner onboarding and delivery enablement.</li>
  <li><strong>Simulated improvements showed potential</strong> NPS boost of ~12% if recommendations were implemented.</li>
